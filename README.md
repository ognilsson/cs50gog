# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Microjournaling

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A wellness webite where users will inout hteir overall happiness and activities during a day, and will then be able to see data
on their overall happiness trend as well as what activities genereally makes them feel good.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Users will have to create an account and login in via a login page each time they visit the website. The user will then ba able to access
a page where the user inputs their overall happiness (on a scale 1-5), what activities they did during the day, and some overall reflections about the day.
The ser can access each previous day's responses under an "Entries" page. They will also be able to see statistics like overall happiness ver time and
average overall feeling under a "Statistics" page. Lastly, the website will also reccomend activities that genereally makes the user happy.
This will be achieved by using algorothms we create based on basic statistsic. We hope this webiste will help people be more aware of what makes them happy
and that they consequently can seek out those activities more often, especially as COVID continues to damage mental health over the world.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TFs below.

George Nageeeb
gnageeb@college.harvard.edu     TF: Johnny Zhang

Galen Lewis
galenlewis@college.harvard.edu      TF: James Conant

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

User login page
User surveys
A well-designed user interface that makes it quick and easy to fill out the survey
Store survey data in a relational database.
Happiness analytics: identify drivers of happiness and sadness
A forgot_password route which allows the user to use their email account to reset their password if forgotten
Social element: see what your friends are doing that is making them happy/sad
Include bits of information from psychological studies that can give recommendations for improving happiness (ex. if the user is sleeping less than a threshold, display a suggestion about how sleep can improve mood).
Send the user daily emails to remind them to complete their survey; allow the user to set the time that they receive the email
Use Bootstrap to make the app accessible by phone
Data visualizations:
Display mood over time
Average sleep duration for each day of the week
Frequency of various activities and the average mood for each activity

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Use more complex data modeling for happiness algorithms (will have to research how machine learning or multiple regression could be applied
Have a page that shows the key results from all of our data (across all users, what is making people happy/sad?)
Use Spotify data (API) to guess user's mood based on the music they have listened to


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Finish a beta version by December 1 and begin collecting user data at that point (so that we have more data to show by the December 9 due date)
Text sentiment analysis: the user can use the app as a journal, entering paragraphs of text each day. The app uses text sentiment analysis to produce a sentiment score. This could be another way of assessing mood (implicitly, instead of explicitly asking the user to state their mood).

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We need to figure out what questions are most effective to ask the user. We also need to set up the basic structure of our application where data is securely saved
so that user can trust it. I will focus (initially) on the journal entry part, George will focus on the diagnostic part, and Galen on presenting our stats in
user friendly ways. Hopefully we can also incorporate any COVID specific insight on mental health we might gain during the process.
