# Happy Track
Especially amidst a global pandemic, there is a growing need for an easy and accessible way for people to keep track of emotions and the activities linked to those emotions.
Monitoring one’s mood is essential for mood management and improving mental health. Given that 1 in 3 US adults had symptoms of clinical anxiety or depression pre-pandemic,
there is an obvious need for better mood management and awareness. COVID-19 has only exacerbated mental stressors. A key to improving mental health is early awareness of
emotional trends and early diagnosis of prolonged distress. A cost-effective and time-tested way to keep track of emotions is journaling, which studies show has proven to not
only improve emotional stability and understanding but also improve physical metrics of health such as blood pressure, liver function, and much more. Our project, HappyTrack,
seeks to revolutionize journaling by using modern micro-journaling technologies to make journaling more efficient and effective for a busy lifestyle. HappyTrack is a smart web
application that helps you manage your wellbeing every day by tracking the mood that you are in and displaying trends in mood while also offering suggestions that cater to your
needs.

## Choosing Preferences:
You begin by registering for an account which will link to your email address in case you need to reset your password via email down the line. The first time that you log in to
your account you will be asked which of 5 life categories you would like to keep track of (if you would wish to specify): Physical Health, Wellness, Hobbies, Social Life, and
Work. If you do not specify, the default is to track all the categories since this is the most comprehensive analysis that you can have. If you wish to change your original
preferences, you can do so on the preferences page which is located under the setting tab in the navigation bar (Settings > Change Preferences). Here you will also see an
opportunity to make your preferences completely private which prevents your data from being aggregated into a summary with the rest of our users, but this will be explained
further later on.

## Journal Entry Pathway:
Once your preferences are selected, you will be redirected to the home page which is where your personalized tips will be for improving your mood and overall mental health.
In order to get tips you will have to submit entries into your digital micro journal. These entries are the crux of the journaling process and a central element to
this web- app. You can initiate the journal entry process by going under the New Entry tab and pressing on New Entry (Enteries > New Entry). This will initiate a new
entry into your journal that begins with a mood entry based on how you feel at the time of your entry. Each mood is linked to a score from 1 (Terrible) - 5 (Amazing)
which becomes important when viewing the visual summary of your entries in the stats page. After selecting your mood you will be redirected to an activities page that
prompts you for some of the activities you have participated in that day. The activities which you can select from are based off of the preferences which you chose to
track upon registering and logging in for the first time. It is important that your activities are linked to the mood that you have chosen earlier in the entry pathway
because this helps HappyTrack to determine which activities contribute most to your happiness or sadness. Following your activities entries you are given two drop down
menu questions that function as a traditional journal for which you can write down a response (as long as you please). These questions encourage you to be reflective on
your day and your activities and utilize some of the benefits of traditional journaling. Because they are promoted, however, this allows for a quicker journaling process
and increased creativity! The questions change randomly for each entry based off of a database of questions which we have created for users. After completing your
written-responses, the last input you must add is the hours of sleep you had the previous night. After this you have completed the journaling pathway and are redirected
to a cumulative summary of your previous entries on the stats page.

## Stats:
The stats portion of this project is split into three parts: happiness, activities, and sleep. The stats page of your happiness (stats > Happiness) shows your average
mood over an adjustable time frame (one week, one month, or one year). If you input multiple mood scores in one day the graph will automatically adjust the summary
statistic on the graph to be the average mood score for that day. The graph of mood score is an essential component of this project as it can show trends in mood that
may go unnoticed by the user. The idea is that if a user can clearly see a low average trend in mood score over a period of time they would consider seeking the
necessary help or change in routine. On the stats page of activities (stats > Activities) you will find a summary of the activity entries which you have inputted.
This graph reveals the activities that you complete most often by keeping track of the net number of times you have done each activity. The purpose of this graph is
to help users get a better sense of what they are spending their time doing and whether there is perhaps a correlation between the activities most often pursued and
the emotional trend shown on the happiness page. Below the activities summary you will find two tables that show which of the activities that you do are most often
related with a high mood score and which activities that you do are most often related to a low mood score. This component is a critical diagnostic tool that can help
users notice trends that affect their moods. It is our hope, that by seeing the relationship between activities and mood, our users will emphasize, or perhaps even
realize, what they love to do and spend more time doing those activities. Thus, if one is ever in a slump they can quickly and clearly be reminded of what activities
usually work best for them to improve their mood. The final stats page underneath the stats tab is the sleep statistics page. This page offers a summary on your
sleeping trends to help you make sure you are getting enough sleep. It shows a graph, over an adjustable window of time, of the sleep hours you are getting on a daily
basis over a period of time. In addition, you get a display that shows the average amount of sleep you get per night. Users are encouraged to get 8 hours of sleep a night!

## Checking Previous Entries:
If you wish to check what your wrote or inputted for a previous entry, all you have to do is go to the history page under the Entries tab in the navigation
bar (Entries > History) and enter the date (or select it from the calendar) of the day for which you want to see your entries. You may find one or multiple
entries on that date.

## Social:
The social tab allows users to see the activities that are most popular amongst all users in our database. A user can opt out of having their information
included in this page using the aforementioned privacy button that is found on the “Change Preferences” page under the settings tab. On this social page users
will find a graph showing the most frequently done activities as well as two tables that delimit the activities which are most often associated with people’s
good moods and those which are most often associated with poor moods amongst users at large. This serves as inspiration for a user to find potential activities
that they might enjoy!

## Habit Builder:
The Habit Builder tab contains a feature intended to help users habitualized an activity that they wish to incorporate in their daily routine.
Inspired by Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics this feature reminds users that “we are what we repeatedly do, excellence then is not an act but rather a habit.”
On this page users are first reminded that a habit, by most professional opinions, takes 18 days of consistent practice to build. Users must then select an
activity that they would like to build a habit in. Once this activity is selected their progress will be displayed as a circular progress bar counting up to their
18 day goal. Users can only update their progress once per day because habits can not be built by doing an activity several times in one day, but rather must be
built by consistency over an elongated period of time. In addition,we encourage users to focus on the habit that they wish to develop which is why we only allow
users to  track one habit at a time. If they please, users may cancel the habit they are currently tracking and begin a new counter but this is strongly discouraged!

## Homepage:
On the home page users will find the three personalized tips for improving their mental health based off of all the information that they have inputted over the
course of their journaling. These tips change based on preferences that are selected.

We hope that this web app will serve users well in keeping track of and improving their overall happiness. If you ever need assistance with mental health issues don’t
hesitate to reach out to a professional. You are not alone. This is HappyTrack!
